4. You’ll learn how to transform a Figma design into a fully functioning website
5. You’ll also learn how to optimize images and store them on the cloud using Cloudinary
6. Provide a quick and easy way for your users to log in and register using Google \*\*\*\*Auth
7. And most importantly, you’ll learn how to build React-based CRUD applications incredibly quickly using refine.
